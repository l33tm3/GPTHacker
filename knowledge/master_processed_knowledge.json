These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.[8] Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting,[8] retrieving, and scent detection.

        "title": "People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behavior and that for guardians of dogs, these effects are relatively long-term.[158] Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.[159] The association between dog ownership and adult physical activity levels has been reviewed by several authors.[160]",

        "title": "The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral and psychological indicators of anxiety.[161] Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases according to the hygiene hypothesis. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs cannot only provide companionship and social support themselves but also act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.[162] One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[163] In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.[164]",

They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka.[174] A black dog is also considered to be the vahana (vehicle) of Bhairava (an incarnation of Shiva).[175]",

        "title": "In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.[170] Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog, after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly after that.[176] As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis) means \"dog of the Lord\" or \"hound of the Lord\" (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis).[176] In Christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege.[177] Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets. Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.[citation needed] The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it as unclean,[170] although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on \"pre-Islamic Arab mythology\" and \"a tradition to be falsely attributed to the Prophet.\"[178] Therefore, Sunni Malaki and Hanafi jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets.[179]",
